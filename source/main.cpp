LAB EXERCISE - BLE Weather Station
 ----------------------------------------
	In this exercise we will create a simple BLE device acquiring data from environmental sensors 
    and providing them through BLE.
    We will use the Nucleo Sensor shield (X-Nucleo-IKS01A3) and the Nucleo BLE shield (X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1).
    The system will be detectable from a cell phone and will allow to activate notifications for
    receiving the environmental measurements.
    We can connect using the nRFConnect App from the smartphone.


	GOOD LUCK!
